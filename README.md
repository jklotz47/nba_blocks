# nba_blocks

My roommate and I were interested in evaluating the true defensive impact of a block. 
This script scrapes basketball-reference.com to catagorize the defensive results from each block from the 2019-2020 NBA season. It determines whether the block led to an offensive or defensive rebound, and whether the other team scored after a block. The analysis can be found at https://medium.com/@harrison.berman/the-value-of-an-nba-block-statistically-speaking-e0f97cf3fe73.
